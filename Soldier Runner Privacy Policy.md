# Soldier Runner : Privacy policy

Welcome To the Soldier Runner Game for Android!  

This is an Android app developed by Me. the app is also available on Google Play.    

As an Android User myself I take pravicy matters very seriously.I know how irritating it is when an app is collecting your data behind your back.  
  
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.  
All the data (Game Progress, etc.) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only and you can delete it simply by erasing the app data or uninstalling the app.  
  
<font size = "8">**This Application doesn't need any special Permissions**</font>  
  
If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.    

Yours Sincerely,
